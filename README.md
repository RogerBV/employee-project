Assesment Web Application - Employee's Web Application

This is a fullstack application for store, list, and update the employee's data. For this application I've used the following techstack:

React, Typescript, Nodejs, Postgresql, Bootstrap 5, Prisma ORM and docker compose.

You can run this application just running the next commands 

  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
  
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

After that, the application will run on http://localhost:5173/
